## Project Overview

Rosario Bridal Boutique is a bridal site for a business located in Eastbourne advertising their unique wedding dresses sold in store by bookable appointments and various other services stated on the site. 

## Design

## Colour 

- For the colour scheme I used black and white as main font colours knowing that white and ivory are very traditional bridal colours and I chose to use a blush pink as my accent colour as it was the colour I created the logo text in. 

## Fonts

- I imported Google fonts and chose to use a calligraphy font called Parisienne for my large headings and Open Sans as the text for the body. 
- I chose to use Parisienne in places where the text was large enough to be easily readable. I did not want to use it in places where the text was too small as it is an intricate font. 

## Pages 
<details><summary>Navigation Bar</summary>
<img src="docs/nav-bar.png">
- The site has a simple structure. When you first arrive on the website you see the navigation bar, which is the same on every page. 
</details>

<details><summary>Homepage</summary>
<img src="docs/homepage.png">
- On the main page it has some welcoming text and some images which link to other pages on the site. Below is a contact form and a footer containing social media links.
</details>

<details><summary>Our Dresses</summary>
<img src="docs/dresses-page.png">
- Our dresses page has a blush pink page title with a black paragraph of text with a little bit of information about what the company offers.
- This is followed by a gallery of wedding dresses.  
</details>

<details><summary>Other Services</summary>
<img src="docs/other-services-page.png">
<img src="docs/other-services-page-2.png">
- This page has a white background, the same as the other pages, with mainly writing outlining the other services offered by the business, but more depth. The offer headings are blush pink in colour in Parisienne font and the body text is Open Sans in black.
- There is a gallery at the bottom of example photos of some of the other services available at Rosario Bridal Boutique. 
</details>

<details><summary>Testimonials</summary>
<img src="docs/testimonials-page-1.png">
<img src="docs/testimonials-page-2.png">
- The testimonials page starts with a gallery of happy brides on their wedding day who have sent in their photos of them in their Rosario Bridal Boutique dresses. 
- It then scrolls down to the "kind words" title in Parisienne font and blush pink.
- Then their testimonials below in Open Sans and black. 
</details>

<details><summary>FAQs</summary>
<img src="docs/faq-page.png">
<img src="docs/faq-page-2.png">
- The FAQ page has a similar layout to the other services page with text at the top and photos at the bottom. The questions being asked are in Parisienne font in blush pink. The answer is in Open Sans below the question in black. All the text is centered for a slimline look.

## Wireframes 

I created the original wireframe for the original Homepage layout of the website. I originally wanted a hero image at the top of the page under the navigation bar, followed by a paragraph section.

## Bugs 

- I have found that on my main page (index.html) some of the images load in the local site on gitpod and look like the website is intended to look. 

- However when the website is deployed, the pictures do not load.

- I asked my community on Slack, I watch many Youtube videos and also my mentor during a session who told me to contact tutor support if I couldn't figure it out. 

- Upon contacting tutor support, they told me it was a very confusing situation and they couldn't figure out why it was happening either, my code is correct in HTML and CSS but it is not deploying so unfortunately my main page does not look finished eventhough the code is there. 

This is the final product:

## Features Left To Implement

- In the testimonials page I would have liked to use a slideshow of photos instead of a gallery.
- A hamburger button to contain the navigation bar for smaller screens.

## Deployment 

- The website is deployed using Github Pages
- In the Settings > Pages
- The source branch is set to 'main'
- The folder is (root)
- It then comes up with a green box to say 'your site is published at "https://alexandra711.github.io/CI_PP1_RBB/"' which is a clickable link to the deployed site.
