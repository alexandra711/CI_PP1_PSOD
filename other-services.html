       <h4>Rosario Bridal Boutique ensures that your experience is the best it can be when choosing your wedding dress, so instead of most 1 hour dress appointments
           we like to give you that extra time with each appointment being 1 hour and 30 minutes. 
           We understand that choosing a dress can be an overwhelming experience, so you are more than welcome to bring a maximum of two people with you to your appointment.
       </h4>

       <h2>Shoes & Accessories</h2>

       <p>At Rosario Bridal Boutique we can provide shoes for you to use when trying on your selection of dresses during your appointment. 
           However, you are more than welcome to bring your own shoes if you have already picked them out or have another similar pair at home. 
           Top tip: we do suggest a similar height to the ones you intend to wear on the day.</p>
