## Project Overview

Rosario Bridal Boutique is a bridal site for a business located in Eastbourne advertising their unique wedding dresses sold in store by bookable appointments and various other services stated on the site. 

## Design

### Colour 

- I used black and white as main font colours knowing that white and ivory are very traditional bridal colours and I chose to use a blush pink as my accent colour as it was the colour I created the logo text in. 

### Font

- I imported Google fonts and chose to use a calligraphy font called Parisienne for my large headings and Open Sans as the text for the body. 

 <h2> Features </h2>
 <h4> When first accessing my website I wanted you to immediately know what the website was for which is why I have recurring features including the logo and nav bar repeated on every page. </h4>

 <h2> Recurring features</h2>
 <ul> 
    <li>I used a matching colour palatte using black text, white background and blush pink accents.</li>
      
  <li>All pages on the Rosario Bridal website feature the same navigation bar throughout, it is responsive to all screen sizes and it also containes the website name/logo which is also a hyperlink to the Home Page.</li>

  <li> The navigation bar allows the user to navigate between all pages.</li>
      
 </ul>

 <h2>Home Page</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>The goal of my homepage was to be minimalist and feminine from the very beginning with a follow through of a </li>
  <li>The Home Page allows the user to see a description of what the business does, also by the main image, and it also provides an address for the "location" and contact number and social media links</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Our Dresses Page</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>On the Our Dresses page I wanted to carry through the colour scheme used on the home page,</li>
  <li>I have also created a div on the bottom of the page to display some previous clients in their dresses</li>
  <li>I wanted this page to have lots of photos of different dresses because it is a very insiprational page to show that the shop has variety and how better than to say it than to show it.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Other Services page and FAQ page</h2>

 <h4>On these pages I have gone for simple and mainly text based pages, where you would come to looking for answers to your questions and they aren't necessarily pages that spark inspiration as much as the other pages.</h4>
 <h4>I have added photos to the bottom of each page in a div so each page has a bridal based photo decoration.</h4>

 <h2>Testimonials page</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>On this page I decided to use a feature picture gallery as the first thing you see on the page. It was intended to be pictures of brides (and their partners) on their wedding day, in their dress bought from the Boutique.</li>
 <li>Below I decided to have a heading saying Your Kind Words and then what they had said.</li>
 <li>My other plans for this section will be touched upon in sections below.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Features left to implement</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the testimonials page I would have liked to use a slideshow of photos instead of a gallery.</li>
<li>A hamburger button to contain the navigation bar for smaller screens.</li>
</ul>
 
 <h2>Wireframe</h2>
