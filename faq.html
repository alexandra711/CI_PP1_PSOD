        <h2 class="faq-heading">When do I start dress shopping?</h2>

        <p>It's never too early or too late to start dress shopping, as unlike other bridal stores, all of our dresses are one of a kind, meaning you can take your dress away with you that very same day if you wish to do so.</p>

        <h2 class="faq-heading">How do I prepare for my appointment?</h2>

        <p>We recommend wearing nude underwear and a strapless bra as sometimes straps can ruin the final look but don't worry, this isn't essential. We have a selection of heels and some other shoes that you can try on with your dresses but if you wish to bring your own you are more than welcome to.</p>
